The drug regimens were tested on a nearly equally divided population (50.6% male and 49.4% female).
Three drug regimens had higher mean tumor volumes than placebo - Ketapril, Naftisol, and Stelasyn. These 3 may be the least effective, but vailidity of that statement requires further analysis.
The correlation coefficient of 0.84 indicates a strong positive linear relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment.
